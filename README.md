# PyANFIS - Python library for Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems

PyANFIS is a Python library that provides a set of tools for designing, training, and using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). ANFIS is a powerful machine learning technique that combines the strengths of neural networks and fuzzy logic to model complex systems with uncertain or imprecise information.

This library includes implementations of various ANFIS architectures, such as the classic Takagi-Sugeno model, as well as extensions and variations that allow for more flexibility and improved performance. It also offers support for different learning algorithms, such as gradient descent and least squares, and different optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.

PyANFIS is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily configure and fine-tune their ANFIS models. It is also well-documented and tested, with a comprehensive set of examples and tutorials that demonstrate its functionality and usage.

This library is being developed as part of a Master's Thesis in the TECI program at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), and is intended to be a useful resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, control engineering, and other related areas.
